            Thought experiments make it obvious that this idea is memetic, and
            just has not been tried in the market. Once one initial company
            opens up this model, many more will follow and copy:
          </p>
          <p>
            For the same price as a Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter can
            be built in Bangladesh for a family in need. This gives rise to the
            idea that anytime someone walks into a designer store and purchased
            an item, they are having to burn down a house (most making this
            decision unknowingly).
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the principle <span class="quote">‚Äúif a penny saved is a penny earned‚Äù we can
            extrapolate that to a Louie bag is a home burned. But just telling
            someone not to flex is not going to solve the problem. If we really
            want to win this war, we just need to sell higher status, for the
            same price."</span>

            Imagine trying to connect with a luxury purse buyer as protestors
            outside of a designer store. Rather than simply protesting their
            spending on that good, we need to sell them a better version of what
            they are buying. Protests outside of stores that sell meat where stands are set up
            showing customers videos of the harmed animals may not be a great
            way to connect with the target audience, and often cause a greater
            divide in mindsets. In this case volunteers or employees could stand outside of luxury
            goods markets, sporting the aligned luxury merch. Rodeo drive for
            example is a notorious spot where every designer store not only has
            a shop, but theres a steady flow of customers.
        
            Social media accounts devoted to making content here are already
            massively viral amassing hundreds of millions of views interviewing
            buyers. Each successful conversion, would make for a viral video and
            an ad set, bringing potentially thousands of new customers while
            kickstarting educating the world of the low status of wasteful
            spending now that a better alternative exists.

					We don‚Äôt need to enforce rules where people are forced to give up

				<p>
					In a subjective culture sense we see IN-YOUR-FACE luxury style
					goods declining while a push for understated looks are coming
					forward. Brands such as Gucci are being seen as more
					oversaturated, and pieces that lack design besides the plastery of
					the luxury logo on the piece are seen as tacky.
				  </p>
				  <p>Evidence of this:
					  <ul>
						  <li>Brands like Gucci are becoming less hip.</li>
						  <li>Designer brands that are in your face are not it.</li>
						  <li>Designer that‚Äôs low-key is now the trend.</li>
						  <li>Designer is dialing back as consumers replace spending to these models.</li>
