            As individuals, once we cover our basic needs, status becomes an
            intrinsic motivator in the rest of our actions. Status comes in many
            forms. The healthiest / most enlightened cultures put the highest
            status in rewarding positive sum behavior. In global culture, luxury
            goods like a Gucci bag/belt have become widespread as top status
            symbols, reflecting vapid use of money as the highest form of
            status. It has become such common Christmas list item for broke
            young teenagers that

            at the time of this writing got his riches from selling these
            overpriced goods representing nothing more than the ability to waste
            money. Collectively this misrepresentation of true status (service
            to others) is attributing more damage to building a healthy positive
            culture than we can imagine.

            Social media, our emergent global cultural production system, could
            be used collectively to unify humanity around bettering ourselves
            and others. Instead it is used to further extract youth through a

            cancelable. One where we collectively take accountability for the
            capability to money to the positive growth of us as a species.
            Imagine a world where the designer things we wore showed off
            spending a lot of money to make a lot of positive impact. If the
            world you imagined only went as far as to redistribute the wealth of
            designer wear, try imagining the deeper cultural effects this new
            alignment would have.

In order to change the failure of redistribution of wealth at scale, we must effectively influence culture and help redefine what ‚Äústatus‚Äù is in the modern age. This will ultimately change the flow of money in society as the new age of status being helping the world, becomes more prominent. We have failed at building a society which healthily distributes wealth/power. Given society is a collective project we are responsible for, we think this stems from the culture not supporting doing good as the highest form of status.  We have more than enough resources, but many people without access to them, and a culture that motivates and glorifies overspending on vanity luxury goods.‚Äù - Jack Jay</p>
