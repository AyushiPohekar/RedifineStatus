              On a fundamental level once someone gets the basics covered as in
              food, water, shelter. They can start to spend their time and money
              on convenience, health, and purpose but more often than not;
              status is where a majority of surplus wealth goes.
            </p>
          </header>
          <p>
            Societally we lack an alignment of our status symbols with creating
            a better world and with bettering ourselves. This idea to change
            what we cultural see as status has been referred to as ‚ÄúStatus
            Engineering‚Äù.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we wear is the most direct way we have to represent ourselves
            and our ideals/values. What your role model wears, or any person of
            influence is shaping the idea of status in that child, teenager, or
            adults mind.
          </p>

          <p>
            Status is what we are buying when we pay $1, $10, or even $500 extra
            for a certain brand of T-Shirt irrespective of comfort.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is not that buying status is a failure mode of an
            individual. Status is a form of positive competitive drive in
            society and a tool for respect attribution. That‚Äôs why you see Dior
            shoes in economy. This is not a miscalculation, currently the status
            from spending $1100 on shoes does have more long term value than
            things like first class because we are playing the game of
            unenlightened capitalism.
          </p>
          <p id="full-para" style="display: none">
            The problem is that we support the status symbol which costs $1100
            and does no good for humanity. Thus this expenditure is not a
            failure of the buyer who bought status, it is only misguided that we
            do not have designer shoes that cost $1100, which builds a literal
            house in Bangladesh (a small home can be built as a permanent
            structure for someone for this amount). We need higher forms of
            status to exist in order to progress our culture which will aid in
            the distribution of wealth and power on a systemic level. Once
            higher status objects are unveiled will these purely financial
            status seems become recognized for their tackiness and buying status
            will coincide with doing good. With no better alternative currently,
            we idolize symbols of wealth. Thus, on our highest display of who we
            are, the clothing we wear, we display 0 creativity or care for the
            world in spending and instead promote wasting wealth for the sake of
            power/leverage over others, and then we wonder why society is
            misaligned to building a healthy world. Fashion, what we wear, is
            the biggest signal we have in representing our identity and values.
            If we can provide a better representation of status in clothing we
            can not only change the money used to buy status into doing good for
            the world, but we can change our core representation of status in
            society towards doing good. While the larger belief is that this
            systemic change is the real impact in realigning our culture towards
            true status, the amount of funds in status spending that could be
            redirected towards positive causes is also no joke.

            Aligning status culturally on a global scale means reattributing
            that wealth towards benefit for humanity and shifting the entire
            global view of wealth.
